        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>
          This project analyzes a dataset of recipes and their user ratings.
          The main goal is to investigate whether a recipe’s <strong>complexity</strong>
          (measured by preparation time and number of steps) is related to its
          average rating.
